<h1>Simple MVC</h1>
<p>This is my simple implementation MVC with ORM. ORM have relations initialized with most simple implementation. We can use it or not.</p>
<p>Script have simple error logger and system of components (with all MVC implementation), plugins (with 6 events) and many more.</p>
<p>Before implementation of relations in ORM it was fast. After is slow (very). Like for now i will not working about it.</p>
<p>This script is showing my skills of PHP, understanding MVC and show how simple is ORM pattern to design,and ORM relations design.</p>
<p>If somebody wants to evolve this script. I can help, like for me it was good practice to do this. But I don't won't to do everything alone : ).</p>
